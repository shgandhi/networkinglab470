## What is it?
Topology Converter can help you to simulate a custom network topology directly on your laptop or on a dedicated server. This topology can be extremely complete allowing for the capability to simulate hosts as well as network equipment. Cumulus Vx (which is the VM of Cumulus Linux) can be leveraged as real routers and switches would be to interconnect hosts. As long as the device is using Linux and has a vagrant box image available, it should be possible to simulate it here as part of a larger topology.
Topology Converter uses a graphviz topology file to represent the entire topology. Topology Converter will convert this topology file into a Vagrantfile which fully represents the topology. Vagrantfiles are used with the popular simulation tool Vagrant to interconnect VMs. The topology can then be simulated in either Virtualbox or Libvirt (/w KVM) using Vagrant.

* v4\.3\.0 2016\_07\_29: Added Initial PXEboot for Libvirt Support. Deprecated ubuntu=true node attribute, it is handled automatically now for images with ubuntu in the name. Modified Functional Defaults to use Ubuntu 14.04 as the host default instead of ubuntu1604 for wider compatability. Fixed Broken Synced Folders flag. Fixed /root/.profile error message output on unsupported platforms. Added Error handling for use of incompatible Ubuntu 1604 images with Libvirt. Updated Example topologies for v4.3.0 supported attributes. Removed Reference Topology. Updated Documentation for Libvirt provider options.

* v3\.4\.4 2016\_03\_31: Added support for MAC handout on any interface, not just a specified MGMT interface.
* v3\.4\.3 2016\_03\_22: Added libvirt interface name support.

* v3\.4 2016\_03\_15 Use Seconds from EPOCH as an extenstion to the unique net number to add some limited network isolation for the vbox use case. Also fixed zipfile generation to include all needed files.
* v3\.3 2016\_03\_09 All Hosts are now remapped by default. Removed Debian_Host_Remaps as a required setting. Added simple true/false check for if the host is Ubuntu. moved "use_vagrant_interface" option into the definitions file; this option creates and uses Vagrant interface instead of the Default 1st interface (usually eth0)
* v3\.2 2016\_03\_08 Significant changes to surrounding packages i.e. rename_eth_swp script. Minor changes to topology converter in the way remap files are generated and hosts run the remap at reboot via rc.local.
* v3\.1 2016\_03\_03 Added Hidden "use_vagrant_interface" option to allow making use of the Vagrant interface optional. Added CLI for Debugging mode.
* v3\.0 2016\_02\_23 Added support for Interface Remapping without reboots on Vx and Hosts (to save time). Moved any remaining topology-specific settings into the definitions files. So topology_converter is truly agnostic and should not need to be modified. Also created an option to disable the vagrant synced folder to further speed boot. Hardened Interface remapping on hosts to work on reboots; and not to pause and wait for networking at reboot. Created remap_eth_swp script that is both hardened and works for both Vx nodes and generic hosts.
* v2\.8 2016\_02\_05 Added support for .def files along with definitions.py so seperate files can be stored in the same directory. Also added support for adding topology files to shareable zipfile.

* v2\.6 2016\_01\_26 Moved provider and switch/server mem settings from topology_converter to definitions.py
* v2\.5 2016\_01\_25 Added libvirt support :) and added support for fake devices!
* v2\.2 2016\_01\_19 Added Support for optional switch interface configuration
* v2\.1 2016\_01\_15 Added Support Boot Ordering -- 1st device --> 2nd device --> servers --> switches
* v2\.0 2016\_01\_07 Added Support for MAC handout, empty ansible playbook (used to generate ansible inventory), [EMPTY] connections for more accurate automation simulation, 
"vagrant" interface remapping for hosts and switches, warnings for interface reuse, added optional support for OOB switch.
* v1\.0 2015\_10\_19 Initial version constructed
